# History:
# - 08/12/13	released for Mari 2.0
# 
# - 08/13/13	Threshold + SoftClip is now evaluated on a normalized version of the noise giving much more even results
# 
# - 12/12/13	Release for Mari 2.5
# 				Added compatibility with Mari Function Lib for Transforms and Noises - requires MARI Function Lib 1.06 or higher
# 				Added Vector FBM
# 				multiFBM Value Mapping is now using a smoother algorithm giving more organic results
# 				Baseline Features added to fbm and vfbm
# 				Amplitute Features added to all FBMs
# 				Invert Feature added to all FBMs
# 				Preview Handle Feature added to multiFBM
# 				Added Ability to invert just negative noise values ("valleys") by using Absolute Value
# 				Added Thresholding to all FBMs
# 				Added Ability to propagate negative noise values as either black or transparent into the end result
# 				Removed Propagation Features from multiFBM to reduce node handling complexity
