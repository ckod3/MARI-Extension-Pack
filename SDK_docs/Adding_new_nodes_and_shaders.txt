Adding new nodes
-----------------
The library structure mimics Mari's Default Structure. 
Node XMLs, glslc and glslh files are automatically loaded without the need for extra python scripts.
Nodes are added to Adjustments or Procedurals depending on the base folder they sit in.
Sorting into subcategories is done via a custom tag inside the XML Files for example
<Category>Geometry/Custom/</Category> will place the node inside the Geometry Folder in Mari's Procedural Menu with a subfolder /Custom/

Stubs for Shaders (Difuse, Specular and Standalone) are available in the Lighting subfolder and are evaluated on load if you place files in there.
