Adding new XML Nodes
-----------------
The library structure mimics Mari's Default Structure. 
Node XML files are automatically loaded without the need for extra python scripts.

Nodes are added to Adjustments or Procedurals depending on the base folder they sit in.

Sorting into subcategories is done via a custom tag inside the XML Files.
<Category>Geometry/Custom/</Category> for example will place the node inside the Geometry Folder in Mari's Procedural Menu with a subfolder /Custom/


Adding new Shaders
-----------------

Shader Files are automatically registered when placed in the following folder structure

Shaders\NodeLibrary\Lighting\Diffuse\
Shaders\NodeLibrary\Lighting\Specular\
Shaders\NodeLibrary\Lighting\Standalone\

The Name of the Shader is extracted from the <ID></ID> Tag


Adding new Functions
-----------------

glslc/glslh files are automatically registered when placed inside the following folder structure

Scripts\Shaders\FunctionLibrary\

Create your own Subfolder to keep things separate.
The LibraryNamer.xml in the \FunctionLibrary\ Folder allows you to set a custom Python Register Printout in the console for your library.

We would encourage you to add your functions to the MariFunctionLib_FunctionOverview.txt file to allow other devs to easily find useful things for their
development
