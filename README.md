GIT Workflow
-----------------
We have adopted the git flow branching model. 

A comprehensive Step-by-Step is available on the Twiki: https://github.com/campi3d/IdeascaleNodePack/wiki/Making-a-change---step-by-step-Tutorial

A demo video is available here: https://vimeo.com/86492303


SUBBRANCH -> DEV -> RELEASE CANDIDATE (Optional) -> MASTER

MASTER is always a released version. 
DEV is the sum of all Development (more or less stable)
Development Branches (referred to as "sub branch" in this document)  are branched off DEV. 

Once a sub branch is completed, a pull request is made to DEV. 
If many changes are made to DEV from different Collaborators,
a RELEASE CANDIDATE Branch may be created from DEV before merged into MASTER.

In order to keep track of things it would be good if major new features just get noted down in the release notes within the DEV Branch
so we have some sort of easy way to assemble release information.
