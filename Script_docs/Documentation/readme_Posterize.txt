Info: ===============================================================

A simple Posterize Adjustment Filter, allowing to set the amount of
colors/values to split the base into.

Requirements: =======================================================

- Mari 2.5 or above



Installation: =======================================================


Take scripts and put them into your user preference script directory.
Or any startup script path that Mari has set. Once these are in 
place, Mari on startup will run through the scripts folder and load
the procedural library. Going to the Python tab and showing the 
console will allow you to see the modules loading up. This is where
if in any case the loading fails it will let you know. 


Example:
	• On Linux+Mac: ~/Mari/Scripts/
	• On Windows: Documents/Mari/Scripts/	


Where to find the nodes: ============================================

The new node is located under the Adjustment/Custom Menu
