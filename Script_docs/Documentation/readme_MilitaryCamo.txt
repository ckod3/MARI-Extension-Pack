Info: ===============================================================

Camo procedural to create military patterns, supporting 3 Colors.
You can easily layer them up to create more elaborate effects by 
Setting Color A to transparent for example.


Requirements: =======================================================

- Mari 2.5 or above
- MARI Function Library 1.07 or above http://mari.ideascale.com/



Installation: =======================================================


Please download and install the MARI Function Library V1.06 or higher
at mari.ideascale.com


Take scripts and put them into your user preference script directory.
Or any startup script path that Mari has set. Once these are in 
place, Mari on startup will run through the scripts folder and load
the procedural library. Going to the Python tab and showing the 
console will allow you to see the modules loading up. This is where
if in any case the loading fails it will let you know. 


Example:
	• On Linux+Mac: ~/Mari/Scripts/
	• On Windows: Documents/Mari/Scripts/	




Where to find the nodes: ============================================

The new nodes are located under Procedurals/Custom/Pattern/
