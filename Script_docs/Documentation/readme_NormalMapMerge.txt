Info: =============================================================================== 

Node to Merge Normal Maps. Apply it as adjustment layer in a stack for a specific layer (NOT in the channel as global adjustment layer)


Requirements: =======================================================================

- Mari 2.5 or above

- Please note: This functionality has been integrated into Mari 2.5+ as a Blend Mode - 

Installation: =======================================================================



Take scripts and put them into your user preference script directory. Or any startup
script path that Mari has set. Once these are in place, Mari on startup will run through
the scripts folder and load the procedural library. Going to the Python tab and showing
the console will allow you to see the modules loading up. This is where if in any case
the loading fails it will let you know. 


Example:
	• On Linux: /Mari/Scripts/
	• On Windows: Documents/Mari/Scripts/	



Where to find the nodes: ============================================================

The Node will appear under the Custom Folder in the Adjustment Layer Dialog.
