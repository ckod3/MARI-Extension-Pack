Info: =============================================================================== 

This is a modification of the default Mari Procedurals. Added functionality includes SEED and Transform (rotate,translate, scale) controls


Requirements: =======================================================================

- Mari 2.5 or above
- MARI Function Library 1.0 or above (http://mari.ideascale.com/)


Installation: =======================================================================


Please download and install the MARI Function Library V1.0 or higher at 
http://mari.ideascale.com/


Take scripts and put them into your user preference script directory. Or any startup
script path that Mari has set. Once these are in place, Mari on startup will run through
the scripts folder and load the procedural library. Going to the Python tab and showing
the console will allow you to see the modules loading up. This is where if in any case
the loading fails it will let you know. 


Example:
	• On Linux: /Mari/Scripts/
	• On Windows: Documents/Mari/Scripts/	



Where to find the nodes: ============================================================

The new nodes are located under the /Procedurals/Custom/ Icon. The Nodes are carrying the Label "Legacy ID"
