Info: =============================================================================== 
A Node to adjust the Normal Map Intensity, while preserving the blue channel.

You can either apply it to a layer via its  adjustment layer stack, or as a channel adjustment layer.

You can also use layer masks on it without problems.

Requirements: =======================================================================

- Mari 2.5 or above


Installation: =======================================================================



Take scripts and put them into your user preference script directory. Or any startup
script path that Mari has set. Once these are in place, Mari on startup will run through
the scripts folder and load the procedural library. Going to the Python tab and showing
the console will allow you to see the modules loading up. This is where if in any case
the loading fails it will let you know. 


Example:
	• On Linux: /Mari/Scripts/
	• On Windows: Documents/Mari/Scripts/	



Where to find the nodes: ============================================================

The NormalMap Intensity Node will appear under the Adjustment Layer Node.
